# Lasni's Lassana Designs – Gallery

This project is a simple gallery site built to showcase the hand-crafted clothing designed and sewn by my mom under the name **Lasni's Lassana Designs**. [web:27][web:34] It focuses on clear visuals of each piece, highlighting the originality of her patterns, the care in her stitching, and the sustainable, small-batch approach behind every garment. [web:20][web:31] The goal is to give family, friends, and potential clients an easy way to browse her work, learn the story behind each item, and appreciate the detail that goes into truly handmade fashion.
